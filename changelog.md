## V1.2
April 5, 2025

Bugfixes and Updates
* Fixed overflow bug on solution test counter.

* Updated the simplify function to allow new algorithms to be added more easily.

* Added Hidden Single algorithum. Siginificantly improves puzzle with many blanks.

* Optimized memory usage to increas speed of simplify and solver

  

Known Issues

<<<<<<< HEAD
* The simplify phase now takes longer to run. This this is helpful in puzzles with many blanks, but puzzles with fewer blanks may solve faster with bruit force approach.
=======
* The Hiden Single is sometimes missing some of the singles
